# Z-ENEMY-1.25-ver.3
This miner is CUDA accelerated software specifically designed for maximum stability and performance. X16R - Ravencoin (RVN) modification coins, X16S - Pigeoncoin (PGN) and Reden (REDN) coins, Luxcoin (LUX), Xevan algo, Tribus algo and Vitalium algo - Vitality (VIT) and other algos. Miner has 1% developer fee for support. Unlike previous versions, this miner is not based on ccminer. The developers (Zealot and Enemy) confirmed that they actively support the development, and their main goal is to correct the real mistakes, they will concentrate on improving the cores as much as possible in order to compress the maximum performance. It is also important to have the latest drivers installed for maximum performance and stability.

IMPORTANT:
For maximum performance make sure you have latest drivers  (ver. 415+)

- Major optimizations for skunk, polytimos and phi
- Minor optimizations for hex and x16r/s, tribus.
- Massive performance boost for RTX 2080/2080ti/2070 in many algorithms.

Other: 
- Highlighted hardware stats reporting, colored GPU temperatures (green/yellow/red)
- Added Volta architecture support
- Important update(1.24 ver.2): Fixed multi-gpu crash bug (skunk and polytimos)
- Important update(1.24 ver.3): Fixed reduced poolside hashrate ( XDNA : hex algo)


Important. This is the third wave of major improvements for Cuda 10
